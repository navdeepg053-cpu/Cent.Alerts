# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values

# Backend API URL
# For production deployment, this should point to your backend URL
# For local development, this might be http://localhost:8000
# Note: In production with Docker, the frontend will be served by the same server
# so you can set this to an empty string or the same domain
